This  repository is for our group project  GPT2 Text Generation with KerasNLP


A. Project Overview

What you did was to use the properties of big language models in keras-nlp package to do natural language processing tasks. Examples of these assignments include text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and language generation.

B. Key Components

You used a dataset for training and testing your model. For instance, you might have employed IMDb movie reviews dataset for sentiment analysis.

The dataset was divided into “train” and “test” sets with as_supervised=True signifying that it is used for supervised learning tasks.

Model Architecture:

Most likely, you adopted a pre-trained language model such as BERT, GPT or other transformer-based models.

The model architecture was fine-tuned using keras-nlp library to meet specific requirements of your problem.

Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization of text data took place as conversion from text to numbers suitable for the model was done.

Different preprocessing approaches like removing stopwords, stemming or lemmatization could be implemented in order to clean-up and normalize the data.

Training:

This supervised learning methodology was used for training the model on the training dataset.

Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs were tuned to improve performance of the model.

Evaluation:

The model's performance was evaluated on the test dataset.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or others relevant to your specific task were used to assess the model's effectiveness.
Deployment:

The trained model was likely deployed in a production environment where it could be used to process new text data.
This involved setting up an API or integrating the model into an existing application.
